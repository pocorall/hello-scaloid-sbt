# Hello Scaloid for sbt

This is a template project that can be a starting point of a new [Scaloid](https://github.com/pocorall/scaloid) project.

This contains minimum code as possible; therefore easy to run, examine and extend.

Prerequisites
-------------
* sbt 0.13.5 or above
* JDK 1.7 or above
* Android build tools 20.0.0 or above
* Android SDK Level 16
<p>Note: Level 16 is required for building, while this app retains runtime compatibility from API Level 10. Please refer to `minSdkVersion` property in `AndroidManifest.xml`</p>

Build
-----
You can build this project using sbt:

    $ sbt android:package

This will compile the project and generate an APK.

Run
-----

    $ sbt android:run

For more command, refer to [android-sdk-plugin for sbt](https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin).

Test
-----
A simple [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) test is implemented. You can run it with:

    $ sbt test


Tips for faster development iteration
-------------------------------------
In sbt, `~` is a prefix that repeatedly runs the command when the source code is modified.

    ~run
    
This sbt command schedules to execute compile-package-deploy-run process after you save the edited source code.
Compiling and packaging runs incrementally, so this iteration takes about only few seconds.

If you use default AVD, try genymotion or other faster virtual device. Deploying apk to the device becomes much faster!


Using IntelliJ IDEA
-------------------
We recommend to use IntelliJ, [not Eclipse](https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin#advanced-usage).

#### Generate the local.properties file

     $ android update project -p src/main --target android-16 # in the root of the project

#### Plugins

Make sure the Scala & [SBT](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/5007?pr=idea) plugins are installed in IntelliJ IDEA

#### Import the SBT project

File -> Open... -> select project root folder -> OK
-> Check "Use auto-import" & for Project SDK, select an Android API platform -> Finish. Choose to configure the
android project when IDEA asks.

[Edit the generated run configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/run-debug-configurations.html). [Add 'Android application' configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/run-debug-configuration-android-application.html). Remove the 'Before launch: Make' then add a new SBT command `android:package` then tab out or it
will not save, then click OK then OK.

You now should be able to run and debug from the run configuration like normal.

Troubleshooting
---------------

#### Troubleshooting IntelliJ

`Local path doesn't exist.` when Intellij tries to deploy the apk.

File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> hello-scaloid-sbt -> Android -> Packaging -> Then choose the APK Path for
the apk. For this project it should be in <code>.../bin/hello-scaloid-sbt-debug.apk</code>

#### Build error `Android SDK build-tools not available`
[The most likely cause of this error is that your SDK build-tools are old.](https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin/issues/13) Update the Android SDK and retry.
